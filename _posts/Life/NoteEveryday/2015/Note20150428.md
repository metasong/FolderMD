On 3 July 2012, Google announced through its blog that several of its services including iGoogle will be retired due to "the unforeseen evolution of web and mobile apps and the erosion of the need for the site." iGoogle retired on November 1, 2013, with the mobile version retired on July 31, 2012.[8]
