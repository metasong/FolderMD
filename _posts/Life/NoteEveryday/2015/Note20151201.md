### How do I convert a bare git repository into a normal one (in-place)?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10637378/how-do-i-convert-a-bare-git-repository-into-a-normal-one-in-place

Start to use GitBook to write 'note every day':
in the past, i use '[MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/)' to write markdown document, this is very useful. MarkdownPad is free for personal use, and you can upgrade to MarkdownPad Pro to unlock additional features and support the developer.

Previously, I use hexo to generate my blog, and host it on the github: [http://metasong.github.io/](http://metasong.github.io/), I use a separate repo to store my .md documents and resources(pictures) [https://github.com/metasong/FolderMD](https://github.com/metasong/FolderMD). to use the picture url has to be like this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/(username)/(repo name)/master/(directory and picture name), for example:[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metasong/FolderMD/master/_posts/Life/NoteEveryday/2015/KenrokuenGarden_ZH-CN11375106351_1920x1080.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metasong/FolderMD/master/_posts/Life/NoteEveryday/2015/KenrokuenGarden_ZH-CN11375106351_1920x1080.jpg).

[Gitbook Editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor/osx) is recently found on [https://www.staticgen.com/](https://www.staticgen.com/). it's free and integrated with Git. you could use the oepn button ![open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metasong/FolderMD/master/_posts/Life/NoteEveryday/2015/gitbook.open.PNG) to open a git repo that stores your markdown documents and picture resources.
